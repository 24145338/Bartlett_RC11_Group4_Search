ADMETUS. Right welcome were she!--But thy love I know. HERACLES. But why this mourning hair, this garb of woe? ADMETUS (_in a comparatively light tone_). There is a burial I must make to-day. HERACLES. God keep all evil from thy children! ADMETUS. Nay, My children live. HERACLES. Thy father, if 'tis he, Is ripe in years. ADMETUS. He liveth, friend, and she Who bore me. HERACLES. Surely not thy wife? 'Tis not Alcestis? ADMETUS (_his composure a little shaken_). Ah; two answers share my thought, Questioned of her. HERACLES. Is she alive or dead? ADMETUS. She is, and is not; and my heart hath bled Long years for her. HERACLES. I understand no more. Thy words are riddles. ADMETUS. Heard'st thou not of yore The doom that she must meet? HERACLES. I know thy wife Has sworn to die for thee. ADMETUS. And is it life, To live with such an oath hung o'er her head? HERACLES (_relieved_). Ah, Weep not too soon, friend. Wait till she be dead. ADMETUS. He dies who is doomed to die; he is dead who dies. HERACLES. The two are different things in most men's eyes. ADMETUS. Decide thy way, lord, and let me decide The other way. HERACLES. Who is it that has died? Thou weepest. ADMETUS. 'Tis a woman. It doth take My memory back to her of whom we spake. HERACLES. A stranger, or of kin to thee? ADMETUS. Not kin, But much beloved.

I would I had found thee on a happier day. ADMETUS. Thy words have some intent: what wouldst thou say? HERACLES. I must find harbour with some other friend. ADMETUS. My prince, it may not be! God never send Such evil! HERACLES. 'Tis great turmoil, when a guest Comes to a mourning house. ADMETUS. Come in and rest. Let the dead die! HERACLES. I cannot, for mere shame, Feast beside men whose eyes have tears in them. ADMETUS. The guest-rooms are apart where thou shalt be. HERACLES. Friend, let me go. I shall go gratefully. ADMETUS. Thou shalt not enter any door but mine. (_To an Attendant_) Lead in our guest. Unlock the furthest line Of guest-chambers; and bid the stewards there Make ready a full feast; then close with care The midway doors. 'Tis unmeet, if he hears Our turmoil or is burdened with our tears. [_The Attendant leads_ HERACLES _into the house_.] LEADER. How, master? When within a thing so sad Lies, thou wilt house a stranger? Art thou mad? ADMETUS. And had I turned the stranger from my door, Who sought my shelter, hadst thou praised me more? I trow not, if my sorrow were thereby No whit less, only the more friendless I. And more, when bards tell tales, were it not worse My house should lie beneath the stranger's
