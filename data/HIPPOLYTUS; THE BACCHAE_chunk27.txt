must fall astray. And thou, Hippolytus, shrink not from the King, Thy father. Thou wast born to bear this thing. Farewell! I may not watch man's fleeting breath, Nor strain mine eyes with the effluence of death. And sure that Terror now is very near. [_The cloud slowly rises and floats away_.] HIPPOLYTUS Farewell, farewell, most Blessèd! Lift thee clear Of soiling men! Thou wilt not grieve in heaven For my long love! ...Father, thou art forgiven. It was Her will. I am not wroth with thee... I have obeyed Her all my days! ... Ah me, The dark is drawing down upon mine eyes; It hath me! ... Father! ... Hold me! Help me rise! THESEUS (_supporting him in his arms_) Ah, woe! How dost thou torture me, my son! HIPPOLYTUS I see the Great Gates opening. I am gone. THESEUS Gone? And my hand red-reeking from this thing! HIPPOLYTUS Nay, nay; thou art assoiled of manslaying. THESEUS Thou leav'st me clear of murder? Sayst thou so? HIPPOLYTUS Yea, by the Virgin of the Stainless Bow! THESEUS Dear Son! Ah, now I see thy nobleness! HIPPOLYTUS Pray that a true-born child may fill my place. THESEUS Ah me, thy righteous and god-fearing heart! HIPPOLYTUS Farewell; A long farewell, dear Father, ere we part! [THESEUS _bends down and embraces him passionately_.] THESEUS Not yet!--O hope and bear while thou hast breath! HIPPOLYTUS Lo, I have borne my burden. This is death... Quick, Father; lay the mantle on my face. [THESEUS _covers his face with a mantle and rises._] THESEUS Ye bounds of Pallas and of Pelops' race, What greatness have ye lost! Woe, woe is me! Thou Cyprian, long shall I remember thee! CHORUS On all this folk, both low and high, A grief hath fallen beyond men's fears. There cometh a throbbing of many tears, A sound as of waters falling. For when great men die, A mighty name and a bitter cry Rise up from a nation calling.
