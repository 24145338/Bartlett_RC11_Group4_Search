to perfume you? CINESIAS By Apollo, no! MYRRHINE By Aphrodite, I'll do it anyway. CINESIAS Lord Zeus, may she soon use up all the myrrh. MYRRHINE Stretch out your hand. Take it and rub it in. CINESIAS Hmm, it's not as fragrant as might be; that is, Not before it's smeared. It doesn't smell of kisses. MYRRHINE How silly I am: I've brought you Rhodian scents. CINESIAS It's good enough, leave it, love. MYRRHINE You must be jesting. CINESIAS Plague rack the man who first compounded scent! MYRRHINE Here, take this flask. CINESIAS I've a far better one.

MEN Baulked in your amorous delight How melancholy is your plight. With sympathy your case I view; For I am sure it's hard on you.

HERALD My scrimp-brained lad, I'm a herald, as ye see, who hae come frae Sparta Anent a Peace. MAGISTRATE Then why do you hide that lance That sticks out under your arms? HERALD. I've brought no lance. MAGISTRATE Then why do you turn aside and hold your cloak So far out from your body? Is your groin swollen With stress of travelling? HERALD By Castor, I'll swear The man is wud. MAGISTRATE Indeed, your cloak is wide, My rascal fellow. HERALD But I tell ye No! Enow o' fleering! MAGISTRATE Well, what is it then? HERALD It's my despatch cane. MAGISTRATE Of course--a Spartan cane! But speak right out. I know all this too well. Are new privations springing up in Sparta? HERALD Och, hard as could be: in lofty lusty columns Our allies stand united. We maun get Pellene. MAGISTRATE Whence has this evil come? Is it from Pan? HERALD No. Lampito first ran asklent, then the others Sprinted after her example, and blocked, the hizzies, Their wames unskaithed against our every fleech. MAGISTRATE What did you do?
