not for thee to know. This day thou diest for thy knavery! CAPTAIN. Stop! Give the watchword quick, before I have thy body on my pike. ODYSSEUS (_in a tone of authority_). Halt every man and have no fear! CAPTAIN. Come, gather round. Be quick to strike. ODYSSEUS (_to_ CAPTAIN). [vv. 686-689] 'Twas thou that killed King Rhesus! CAPTAIN. No: 'tis I that kill the man that killed . . . [_Flies at_ ODYSSEUS, _but other men hold him back_. ODYSSEUS. Hold back all! VOICES. No more holding back! ODYSSEUS (_as they attack him_). What, strike an ally in the field? CAPTAIN. Then give the watchword! ODYSSEUS. Phoebus. CAPTAIN. Right. Ho, every man hold back his spear!-- Then know'st thou where the men are gone? ODYSSEUS. We saw them running, somewhere here. [_He makes off into the darkness._ DIOMEDE _follows, and some Thracians_. CAPTAIN. [vv. 690-703] Off every one upon their track! A MAN. Or should we rouse the army? CAPTAIN. No; To stir the allies in the night and make more panic! Let us go. [_The Thracians go off in pursuit.

DIVERS GUARDS (_talking_). [vv. 704-724] This night must be Odysseus' work, or whose?-- Odysseus? Aye, to judge by ancient use.-- Odysseus surely!--That is thy belief?-- What else? It seems he hath no fear Of such as we!--Whom praise ye there? Whose prowess? Say!--Odysseus.--Nay, Praise not the secret stabbing of a thief! CHORUS. He came once, of old, Up thro' the city throng, Foam on his lips, a-cold, Huddled in rags that hung Covering just the sword Hid in his mantle's pleat; His face grimed and scored, A priest of wandering feet, Who begged his bread in the street. Many and evil things He cast on the brother kings Like one long hurt, who nurseth anger sore; Would that a curse, yea, would The uttermost wrath of God Had held those feet from walking Ilion's shore! DIVERS GUARDS (_talking_). Odysseus or another, 'tis the guard Will weep for this. Aye, Hector will be hard.-- What will he say?--He will suspect.--Suspect? What evil? What should make you fear?-- [vv. 725-737] 'Twas we that left a passage clear.-- A passage?--Yea, for these men's way, Who came by night into the lines unchecked.
