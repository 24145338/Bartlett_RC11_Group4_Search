to your market. DICAEOPOLIS Well, how are things at Megara?(1) f(1) Megara was allied to Sparta and suffered during the war more than any other city because of its proximity to Athens. MEGARIAN We are crying with hunger at our firesides. DICAEOPOLIS The fireside is jolly enough with a piper. But what else is doing at Megara, eh? MEGARIAN What else? When I left for the market, the authorities were taking steps to let us die in the quickest manner. DICAEOPOLIS That is the best way to get you out of all your troubles. MEGARIAN True. DICAEOPOLIS What other news of Megara? What is wheat selling at? MEGARIAN With us it is valued as highly as the very gods in heaven! DICAEOPOLIS Is it salt that you are bringing? MEGARIAN Are you not holding back the salt? DICAEOPOLIS 'Tis garlic then? MEGARIAN What! garlic! do you not at every raid grub up the ground with your pikes to pull out every single head? DICAEOPOLIS What DO you bring then? MEGARIAN Little sows, like those they immolate at the Mysteries. DICAEOPOLIS Ah! very well, show me them. MEGARIAN They are very fine; feel their weight. See! how fat and fine. DICAEOPOLIS But what is this? MEGARIAN A SOW, for a certainty.(1) f(1) Throughout this whole scene there is an obscene play upon (a) word which means in Greek both 'sow' and 'a woman's organs of generation.' DICAEOPOLIS You say a sow! Of what country, then? MEGARIAN From Megara. What! is it not a sow then? DICAEOPOLIS No, I don't believe it is. MEGARIAN This is too much! what an incredulous man! He says 'tis not a sow; but we will stake, an you will, a measure of salt ground up with thyme, that in good Greek this is called a sow and nothing else. DICAEOPOLIS But a sow of the human kind. MEGARIAN Without question, by Diocles! of my own breed! Well! What think you? will you hear them squeal? DICAEOPOLIS Well, yes, I' faith, I will. MEGARIAN Cry quickly, wee sowlet; squeak up, hussy, or by Hermes! I take you back to the house. GIRL Wee-wee, wee-wee! MEGARIAN Is that a little sow, or not? DICAEOPOLIS Yes, it seems so; but let it grow up, and it will be a fine fat bitch. MEGARIAN In five years it will be just like its mother. DICAEOPOLIS But it cannot be sacrificed. MEGARIAN And why not? DICAEOPOLIS It has no tail.(1) f(1) Sacrificial victims were bound to be perfect in every part; an animal, therefore, without a tail could not be offered. MEGARIAN Because it is quite young, but in good time it will have a big one, thick and red. DICAEOPOLIS The two are as like as two peas. MEGARIAN They are born of the same father and mother; let them be fattened, let them grow their bristles, and they will be the finest sows you can offer to Aphrodite. DICAEOPOLIS But sows are not immolated to Aphrodite. MEGARIAN Not sows
