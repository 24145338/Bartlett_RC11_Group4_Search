thought--his mind is sick. [Sidenote: vv. 551-562] OEDIPUS. Who thinks to slay his brother with a trick And suffer not himself, his eyes are blind. CREON. Thy words are more than just. But say what kind Of wrong thou fanciest I have done thee. Speak. OEDIPUS. Didst urge me, or didst urge me not, to seek A counsel from that man of prophecies? CREON. So judged I then, nor now judge otherwise. OEDIPUS. [_Suddenly seeing a mode of attack._ How many years have passed since Laïus ... [_The words seem to choke him._ CREON. Speak on. I cannot understand thee thus. OEDIPUS. [_With an effort._ Passed in that bloody tempest from men's sight? CREON. Long years and old. I scarce can tell them right. OEDIPUS. At that time was this seer in Thebes, or how? [Sidenote: vv. 563-573] CREON. He was; most wise and honoured, even as now. OEDIPUS. At that time did he ever speak my name? CREON.

That charge it is not in me to gainsay. CREON. Thou reignest, giving equal reign to her? OEDIPUS. Always to her desire I minister. CREON. Were we not all as one, she thou and I? OEDIPUS.
