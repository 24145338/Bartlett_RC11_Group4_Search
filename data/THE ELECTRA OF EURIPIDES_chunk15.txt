me. But ... where is she? OLD MAN. In Argos now, I guess; But goes to join her husband, ere the press Of the feast. ORESTES. Why goeth not my mother straight Forth at her husband's side? OLD MAN. She fain will wait Until the gathered country-folk be gone. ORESTES. Enough! She knows what eyes are turned upon Her passings in the land! OLD MAN. Aye, all men hate The unholy woman. ORESTES. How then can I set My snare for wife and husband in one breath? ELECTRA (_coming forward_). Hold! It is I must work our mother's death. ORESTES. If that be done, I think the other deed Fortune will guide. ELECTRA. This man must help our need, One friend alone for both. OLD MAN. He will, he will! Speak on. What cunning hast thou found to fill Thy purpose? ELECTRA. Get thee forth, Old Man, and quick Tell Clytemnestra ... tell her I lie sick, New-mothered of a man-child. OLD MAN. Thou hast borne A son!

Here am I, To speed thee to the end, right thankfully. ORESTES (_turning as he goes and raising his hands to heaven_). Zeus of my sires, Zeus of the lost battle, ELECTRA. Have pity; have pity; we have earned it well! OLD MAN. Pity these twain, of thine own body sprung! ELECTRA. O Queen o'er Argive altars, Hera high, ORESTES. Grant us thy strength, if for the right we cry. OLD MAN. Strength to these twain, to right their father's wrong! ELECTRA. O Earth, deep Earth, to whom I yearn in vain, ORESTES. And deeper thou, O father darkly slain, OLD MAN. Thy children call, who love thee: hearken thou! ORESTES. Girt with thine own dead armies, wake, O wake! ELECTRA. With all that died at Ilion for thy
