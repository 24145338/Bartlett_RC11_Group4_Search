_To husband or lover I'll not open arms_ LYSISTRATA Though love and denial may enlarge his charms. CALONICE _Though love and denial may enlarge his charms._ O, O, my knees are failing me, Lysistrata! LYSISTRATA But still at home, ignoring him, I'll stay, CALONICE _But still at home, ignoring him, I'll stay,_ LYSISTRATA Beautiful, clad in saffron silks all day. CALONICE _Beautiful, clad in saffron silks all day._ LYSISTRATA If then he seizes me by dint of force, CALONICE _If then he seizes me by dint of force,_ LYSISTRATA I'll give him reason for a long remorse. CALONICE _I'll give him reason for a long remorse._ LYSISTRATA I'll never lie and stare up at the ceiling, CALONICE _I'll never lie and stare up at the ceiling,_ LYSISTRATA Nor like a lion on all fours go kneeling. CALONICE _Nor like a lion on all fours go kneeling._ LYSISTRATA If I keep faith, then bounteous cups be mine. CALONICE _If I keep faith, then bounteous cups be mine._ LYSISTRATA If not, to nauseous water change this wine. CALONICE _If not, to nauseous water change this wine._ LYSISTRATA Do you all swear to this? MYRRHINE We do, we do.
