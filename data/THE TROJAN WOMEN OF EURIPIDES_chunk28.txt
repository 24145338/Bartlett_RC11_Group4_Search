My Troy, mine own, take me to die with thee! [_She springs toward the flames, but is seized and held by the Soldiers._ TALTHYBIUS. Back! Thou art drunken with thy miseries, Poor woman!--Hold her fast, men, till it please Odysseus that she come. She was his lot Chosen from all and portioned. Lose her not! [_He goes to watch over the burning of the City. The dusk deepens._ CHORUS. _Divers Women._ Woe, woe, woe! Thou of the Ages, O wherefore fleëst thou, Lord of the Phrygian, Father that made us? 'Tis we, thy children; shall no man aid us? 'Tis we, thy children! Seëst thou, seëst thou? _Others._ He seëth, only his heart is pitiless; And the land dies: yea, she, She of the Mighty Cities perisheth citiless! Troy shall no more be! _Others._ Woe, woe, woe! Ilion shineth afar! Fire in the deeps thereof, Fire in the heights above, And crested walls of War! _Others._ As smoke on the wing of heaven Climbeth and scattereth, Torn of the spear and driven, The land crieth for death: O stormy battlements that red fire hath riven, And the sword's angry breath! [_A new thought comes to_ HECUBA; _she kneels and beats the earth with her hands_. HECUBA. [_Strophe._ O Earth, Earth of my children; hearken! and O mine own, _Ye_ have hearts and forget not, _ye_ in the darkness lying! LEADER. Now hast thou found thy prayer, crying to them that are gone. HECUBA. Surely my knees are weary, but I kneel above your head; Hearken, O ye so silent! My hands beat your bed! LEADER. I, I am near thee; I kneel to thy dead to hear thee, Kneel to mine own in the darkness; O husband, hear my crying! HECUBA. Even as the beasts they drive, even as the loads they bear, LEADER. (Pain; O pain!) HECUBA. We go to the house of bondage. Hear, ye dead, O hear! LEADER. (Go, and come not again!) HECUBA. Priam, mine own Priam, Lying so lowly, Thou in thy nothingness, Shelterless, comfortless, See'st thou the thing I am? Know'st thou my bitter stress? LEADER. Nay, thou art naught to him! Out of the strife there came, Out of the noise and shame, Making his eyelids dim, Death, the Most Holy! [_The fire and smoke rise constantly higher._ HECUBA. [_Antistrophe._ O high houses of Gods, belovèd streets of my birth, Ye have found the way of the sword, the fiery and blood-red river! LEADER. Fall, and men shall forget you! Ye shall lie in the gentle earth. HECUBA. The dust as smoke riseth; it spreadeth wide its wing; It maketh me as a shadow, and my City a vanished thing! LEADER. Out on the smoke she goeth, And her name no man knoweth; And the cloud is northward, southward; Troy is gone for ever! [_A great crash is heard, and the Wall is lost in smoke and darkness._ HECUBA. Ha! Marked ye? Heard ye? The crash of the towers that fall! LEADER. All
